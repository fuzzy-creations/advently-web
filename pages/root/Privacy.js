                When we share personal data, we do so in accordance with Data Protection
                    law. We may share certain personal data, where necessary, with employees,
                    contractors, consultants or advisers, to facilitate sales and for general
                    commercial purposes

                <li>
                We may also provide third parties with aggregated but anonymised
                    information and analytics about our customers. Before we do so we will make
                    sure that it does not identify you.

                <li>
                In some cases, when we share personal data, it will involve the transfer of
                    that personal data to countries outside the UK which have different data
                    protection standards to those which apply in the UK.

                    are adequate safeguards to protect your privacy rights under Data
                    Protection Law.

                </li>
                <li>
                request that we erase your personal information in some circumstances, or
                    object to our processing it as detailed at paragraph 8.5;

                You have a right to object to our processing of your personal data and ask
                    us to stop doing so. If we are processing your personal data or direct

                    related to such direct marketing) and you object to this, we will stop
                    processing your personal data immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                If our processing of your personal data including any profiling activities
                    is in the public interest or pursuant to our legitimate interests and you
                    object to this, we will stop processing your personal data unless we have
                    compelling reasons which override your interests, or our use of your
                    personal data is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
                    claims.

                When we ask for your personal data we will tell you whether you are
                    required by law or contract to provide it, and what will happen if you do
                    not provide the data.

                    that processing. The table at the end of this notice sets out the lawful
                    basis we rely on for each type of data we process.
